## About SoFaygo-OG-Files
SoFaygo-OG-Files is a SoFaygo discography compilation, containing both original and modified song files, organized by era. If you find anything in this compilation that is inaccurate, or have a suggestion for any files I should add, please feel free to [reach out](https://discordapp.com/users/309659916858294273) or submit a pull request!

The goal of this project is to provide a **complete and accurate collection** of all SoFaygo song files in one place.

> Note: While you can play files directly from this compilation, it is **not intended** for casual listening. Most files are **untagged** and **unaltered** from their original sources. This is simply a **raw archive** you can use to create your own tagged and organized compilation.

If you’re looking for a more polished and **playback-friendly** experience with **tagged and edited files**, check out [**SoFaygo Sessions**](https://github.com/HeyItsMicro/SoFaygo-Sessions).
