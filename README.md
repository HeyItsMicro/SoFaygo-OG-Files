# SoFaygo-OG-Files
A SoFaygo discography compilation containing both original ("OG") and full song files, organized by era. Created and maintained by HeyItsMicro.

The goal of this project is to have a complete and accurate collection of all SoFaygo song files in one place. If you find anything in this compilation that is inaccurate, or have a suggestion for any files I should add, please feel free to [reach out](https://discordapp.com/users/309659916858294273) or submit a pull request!

### Key
**Full File** - The entire song is available, though it could be edited or altered in some way. <br/>
**OG File**	- The original, unmodified file of a song is available. Usually has the best sound quality.

### Releases
Releases can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/HeyItsMicro/SoFaygo-OG-Files/releases) and [MEGA](https://mega.nz/folder/M3N3SahJ#4lAW8vT1NL41MABUobx_gw), I will keep both up to date. MEGA last updated with v1.10.0 on May 4th, 2025.
