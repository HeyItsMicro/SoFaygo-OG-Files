# SoFaygo-OG-Files
A SoFaygo discography compilation containing both original ("OG") and full song files, organized by era. Created and maintained by HeyItsMicro. If you find anything in this compilation that is inaccurate, or have a suggestion for any files I should add, please feel free to [reach out](https://discordapp.com/users/309659916858294273) or submit a pull request! 

The goal of this project is to provide a **complete and accurate collection** of all SoFaygo song files in one place.

> Note: While you can play files directly from this compilation, it is **not intended** for casual listening. Most files are **untagged** and **unaltered** from their original sources. This is simply a **raw archive** you can use to create your own tagged and organized compilation.

If youâ€™re looking for a more polished and playback-friendly experience with **tagged and edited files**, check out [SoFaygo Seessions](https://github.com/HeyItsMicro/SoFaygo-Sessions).

### Key
**Original File* - The original, unmodified file of a song is available. Usually has the best sound quality.
**Modified File** - The entire song is available, though it could be edited or altered in some way. <br/>
